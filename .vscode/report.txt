Data quality and outliers
- Outliers (IQR & Z‑score)
- Variables with highest IQR outlier rates:
- TrainingTimesLastYear: 16.2% of records outside the expected IQR range.
- PerformanceRating: 15.4% outside IQR (discrete variable concentrated at 3 and 4).
- MonthlyIncome: 7.8% outliers (very high values relative to the median).
- YearsSinceLastPromotion: 7.3% outliers (some employees >10 years without promotion).
- YearsAtCompany: 7.1% outliers (employees up to 40 years at the company).
- StockOptionLevel: 5.8% outliers (high levels are rare).
- TotalWorkingYears: 4.3% outliers (very long careers).
- Z‑score > 3 flags also appear for YearsSinceLastPromotion, YearsAtCompany and TotalWorkingYears.
- Stable variables (no meaningful outliers): age, distance from home, satisfaction scores, involvement, standard hours, etc.
- Missingness
- No missing values detected in any column.
- Missingness correlation matrix is fully NaN, confirming absence of missing data.
Business insights
- Training allocation: the high outlier rate in TrainingTimesLastYear indicates some employees receive far more or far fewer trainings than the majority, suggesting inconsistent training policies.
- Performance ratings: low variance and clustering at a single score (mostly 3) make outlier detection here an artifact; this suggests a non‑discriminative performance evaluation process.
- Monthly income dispersion: extreme high incomes relative to the median may create perceived pay inequities among similar roles.
- Promotions and tenure: outliers in YearsSinceLastPromotion and YearsAtCompany point to employees with long periods without promotion or exceptionally long tenure, which can drive frustration and exits.
- Stock options: skewed distribution indicates few employees receive high‑level stock options, potentially affecting retention of strategic talent.
- Data provenance: absence of missingness is positive but should be validated to ensure no artificial preprocessing masked real gaps.
Recommendations for managers
- Training policy: review and standardize training allocation; target employees with unusually low or high training counts for development or reassignment.
- Performance evaluation: redesign appraisal processes to increase discrimination and better identify high performers and development needs.
- Pay equity audit: analyze salary ranges within comparable roles and address unjustified disparities.
- Promotion pathways: implement clear progression plans and more frequent promotion review cycles to reduce long promotion gaps.
- Retention incentives: broaden access to long‑term incentives (e.g., stock options) for critical roles to improve retention.
- Data governance: validate data provenance and preprocessing steps to confirm that the dataset accurately reflects operational reality.

- Technical reading of results Target distribution
- Attrition: 16.1% left (237 of 1,470). Strong class imbalance.

5. 	Multivariate analysis (done & persisted)

• 	Pearson & Spearman correlations, VIF, Cramér’s V matrix, pairplots and 2D hotspot grids computed and saved to data/clean/eda/multivariate/{tables,figures}.
• 	Mutual information and decile profiles added for nonlinear and monotonic checks.
• 	Top correlation lists, VIF table, Cramér’s V matrix and hotspot CSVs available for review.

Technical readout of results
VIF — Multicollinearity
- Critical values:
- JobLevel (11.21) and MonthlyIncome (10.80) — both > 10, indicating strong redundancy.
- Interpretation: job level and monthly income act as near proxies for each other.
- Moderate values:
- TotalWorkingYears (4.77), YearsAtCompany (4.59), YearsWithCurrManager (2.77), YearsInCurrentRole (2.72).
- Interpretation: professional trajectory variables are correlated but at acceptable levels.
- Other variables: VIF ≈ 1 — statistically independent.
Cramér’s V — Association between categoricals
- Most associations are low or negligible (0.0–0.03).
- Notable exceptions:
- MaritalStatus ↔ StockOptionLevel: 0.475.
- Department ↔ WorkLifeBalance: 0.038 (still low).
- Interpretation: categorical variables are generally independent for modeling, but the MaritalStatus–StockOptionLevel association suggests potential bias in benefits allocation.
2D Hotspot — OverTime × MaritalStatus
- Employees without overtime:
- Divorced → 6.1% attrition.
- Married → 8.4% attrition.
- Single → 16.2% attrition.
- Employees with overtime:
- Divorced → 19.2% attrition.
- Married → 23.1% attrition.
- Single → 49.6% attrition.
- Interpretation: single employees who work overtime have extremely high exit risk (≈49.6%); risk factors multiply when combined.
Business insights
- Structural multicollinearity:
- Income, job level and years of experience convey the same signal; choose one variable or apply regularization for predictive models.
- Benefits and marital status:
- The MaritalStatus–StockOptionLevel association suggests married/divorced employees may receive more stock options than singles, risking perceived unfairness and contributing to single employees’ exits.
- Critical hotspot:
- Single + OverTime = extreme risk group (≈49.6% attrition); combines low social support, high workload and weaker long-term attachment.
Recommendations for managers
- Feature simplification:
- Use either JobLevel or MonthlyIncome (not both) in reports and models; apply Lasso/Ridge to address collinearity.
- Benefits policy:
- Review stock option allocation criteria to remove potential bias by marital status; consider expanding long-term incentives for vulnerable groups (e.g., single employees).
- Overtime management:
- Monitor single employees with high overtime; offer wellbeing programs, flexibility and targeted recognition to reduce burnout and exits.
- Hotspot monitoring:
- Build HR dashboards combining variables (e.g., OverTime × MaritalStatus) to identify high-impact intervention groups and prioritize targeted actions.


6. 	Advanced signal checks (completed where possible)
• 	Mutual Information vs target computed and saved (mutual_information_vs_target.csv); fallback note added if sklearn not available.

8. 	Modeling & calibration (completed experiments)

• 	RandomizedSearchCV run for LR (with L1 selection), RF, HGB and KNN (40 candidates, 5‑fold CV each).
• 	Calibrated models produced using CalibratedClassifierCV where applicable; pipelines and calibrated objects saved under models/ and MODEL_DIR (e.g., calibrated_rf_pipeline.pkl).
• 	Threshold tuning performed (objective: precision ≥ 0.30) and operational thresholds recorded:
• 	Logistic Regression: thr ≈ 0.095 -> recall ≈ 0.787, precision ≈ 0.301
• 	Random Forest: thr = 0.10    -> recall ≈ 0.851, precision ≈ 0.310
• 	HGB: thr ≈ 0.155   -> recall ≈ 0.681, precision ≈ 0.305
• 	KNN: thr ≈ 0.135   -> recall ≈ 0.723, precision ≈ 0.301
• 	Stability testing: RepeatedStratifiedKFold (3×5) run for RF showed high recall and acceptable precision variability; results saved to MODEL_DIR (rf_stability_repeated_cv.csv, rf_stability_summary.json).

Summary of results and operational decision
Models evaluated (tuning + calibration)
- Logistic Regression
- ROC-AUC: 0.8139; PR-AUC: 0.6008
- threshold = 0.5 → precision 0.739; recall 0.362
- threshold tuned (precision ≥ 0.30) → thr ≈ 0.095 → recall ≈ 0.787; precision ≈ 0.301
- Random Forest
- ROC-AUC: 0.8036; PR-AUC: 0.4359
- threshold = 0.5 → precision 0.458; recall 0.234
- threshold tuned (precision ≥ 0.30) → thr = 0.10 → recall ≈ 0.851; precision ≈ 0.310
- HistGradientBoosting (HGB)
- ROC-AUC: 0.7639; PR-AUC: 0.4724
- threshold tuned (precision ≥ 0.30) → thr ≈ 0.155 → recall ≈ 0.681; precision ≈ 0.305
- KNN
- PR-AUC: 0.4053; lower performance for this objective
Deployment recommendation (objective: identify positive attrition while considering precision)
- Preferred deploy: Random Forest (calibrated) with threshold = 0.10
- Rationale: highest operational recall (~85%) while maintaining precision ≈ 0.31.
- Operational implication: higher volume of alerts and more false positives to investigate.
- Alternative (if investigation capacity is constrained): Logistic Regression (calibrated) with threshold ≈ 0.095
- Rationale: better PR-AUC and more stable probabilities; still high recall (~79%) with similar precision.
Recommended rollout approach
- Run Random Forest and Logistic Regression in shadow/parallel for 2–4 weeks.
- During pilot, track: alerts per day, observed precision (confirmation rate), recall where ground truth is available, and average cost per investigation.
- Choose the active model with HR based on empirical alert volume, confirmation rate, and acceptable investigation cost.
